Greedy algorithm :-

The greedy method is one of the strategies like Divide and conquer used to solve the problems.used for solving optimization problems
The Greedy method is the simplest and straightforward approach. It is not an algorithm, but it is a technique. 
This technique is basically used to determine the feasible solution that may or may not be optimal

Components of Greedy Algorithm :-
Greedy algorithms have the following five components −

candidate set − A solution is created from this set.
selection function − Used to choose the best candidate to be added to the solution.
feasibility function − Used to determine whether a candidate can be used to contribute to the solution.
objective function − Used to assign a value to a solution or a partial solution.
solution function − Used to indicate whether a complete solution has been reached.

Applications of Greedy Algorithm :-
It is used in finding the shortest path.
It is used to find the minimum spanning tree using the prim's algorithm or the Kruskal's algorithm.
It is used in a job sequencing with a deadline.
This algorithm is also used to solve the fractional knapsack problem.
  
  
Examples :-

Travelling Salesman Problem
Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
Knapsack Problem



=======================================================================================


0/1 knapsack problem means that the items are either completely or no items are filled in a knapsack.
fractional knapsack problem means that we can divide the item

Types of Knapsack Problem :-

1. Fractional Knapsack Problem:- 
we can break items for maximizing the total value of the knapsack.
solved using a greedy approach.
we can take objects in fractions in floating points

2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem :- 
we are not allowed to break items
solved using dynamic programming approach
we can take objects in an integer value

Bellman Ford Algorithm :-
Bellman ford algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm. 
This algorithm is used to find the shortest distance from the single vertex to all the other vertices of a weighted graph.

N-Queens Problem:-

This problem is to find an arrangement of N queens on a chess board, such that no queen can attack any other queens on the board.
The chess queens can attack in any direction as vertical, horizontal and diagonal way.

Algorithm :-
Begin
   if there is a queen at the left of current col, then
      return false
   if there is a queen at the left upper diagonal, then
      return false
   if there is a queen at the left lower diagonal, then
      return false;
   return true //otherwise it is valid place
End

Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) :-
the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point
There are various approaches to find the solution to the travelling salesman problem: greedy approach, dynamic programming approach, etc.

Linear Regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm 
that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables
